# 🛒 Supermarket Performance Analysis using SQL

![Banner](https://github.com/Salmaraafat/Supermarket-branches/blob/main/Title.png)

## 📌 Overview

This project explores a **retail supermarket dataset** uploaded to SQL Server.  
Using structured SQL queries, we analyze **store performance** through metrics like:
- Store area  
- Items available  
- Customer traffic  
- Daily sales  

The analysis identifies top/bottom performing stores, efficiency patterns, and potential outliers.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **SQL Server**  
- **Structured Query Language (SQL)**  
- **PDF** for storytelling report
  
  ## 📊 Key Analyses

- Average sales across all stores  
- Highest and lowest performing stores  
- Sales vs. store area  
- Efficiency metrics:  
  - Sales per square meter  
  - Sales per item  
  - Sales per customer  
- Outlier detection (unusually high/low sales)
- Grouping stores by performance bands

  ## 💡 Insights

- 📉 **Bigger stores don’t always mean better performance.**  
- 🚀 Some small stores outperform larger ones in **sales efficiency**.  
- 🔍 A few stores show extreme highs/lows—likely **outliers** needing attention.  
- 👥 **Sales per customer** is a fair performance metric for comparisons.

  ## ✅ Conclusion

This analysis provided a deeper understanding of supermarket performance beyond total sales.  
By focusing on **sales per area, customer, and item**, we highlighted:

- Efficient stores regardless of size  
- Underperforming large stores  
- Opportunities to **benchmark**, **improve**, and **allocate resources** smartly.
